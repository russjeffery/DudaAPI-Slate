# Responsive sites

A site instance resource represents a single responsive Duda website. In the documentation below, responsive websites are referred to as multiscreen websites. They are the same thing. 

## Create site

Call the DudaAPI to create a new multiscreen site. This site will be created in the master account associated with the API key you are using. Creating a site will return a unique site name to reference this site resource.  Please note that sites created using this call will be set to Business+ status by default, but will not begin charging you until they are published. Please review the Payments and Publishing section for details.

### Method and path
`POST /sites/multiscreen/create`

### Arguments
> Full create site JSON representation. Only the template_id is required.

Property | Type | Required | Description
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
template_id | Int | Required | Template ID of the template you want to base your new Responsive site on. You can see the API to get available templates [here](#get-templates).
url | String | optional | Have Duda import content into the new site based from an existing website. You may use an existing website address or Facebook business page. 
lang | String | optional | Set the language of the website. This controls the default copy (based on the template), widget outputs and other language specific text. See available [languages](#languages) above.
default_domain_prefix | String | optional | Set the default sub-domain for your site. This controls the <sub-domain-prefix>.dudaone.com address. 
site_data | Object | optional | JSON object containing additional site data. See below for the options and properties.
site_alternate_domain | Object | optional | Set alternate domains for the site. The alternate domain values will be redirected to the primary domain (set in the site_data object). 

The description for the site_data object is below:

Property | Type | Required | Description
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
site_domain | String | optional | Set the domain of the site. This will be: www.example.com. This will be used when the site is published. This must be unique inside of the Duda platform. 
external_uid | string | optional | A flexible string you pass to Duda when creating the site, allows you to store your customer's unique value to reference later (45 char max). Note that Duda does not enforce uniqueness here.
business_site_info | Object | optional | Pass Duda detailed information about this business / website.

### site_business_info object
Provides structured data about a website or business. Duda will use this information to help populate the website with this data and fill the [content library](https://help.dudamobile.com/hc/en-us/articles/229790908-Manage-Content-Library) with data. All data fields are optional.

<aside class="notice">If you pass business_site_info during site create, this will trigger Duda's content import algorithm and we will attempt to import content from across the web based on the input data. This might result in a longer response time to create the website.</aside>

Property | Type | Description
---------- | ---------- | ----------
business_name | String |  The name of the business for the site being created
phone_number | String | The primary phone number for the business. 
address | Object | An object containing address details (city, state, zip, etc..)
opentable_info | Object | An object containing arrays of possible opentable IDs.

### Address object 
Providing an address helps the site creation process by giving Duda more information about the location of the business. For example, if you provide an address, we will automatically populate a maps element and potentially find other resources online to assist in site creation. 


Property | Type | Description
---------- | ---------- | ----------
Street | String | A street level line location (e.g. 123 Main Street)
State | String | The state of where the business is located
Country | String | The country of where the business is located
zip_code | String | The Zip Code or Postal Code of the business

### OpenTable object
Providing this will create an OpenTable button and help Duda find more information about the website online. This should be an array of JSON objects, as you can provide multiple restaurant_id's while creating the site.

Property | Type | Description
---------- | ---------- | ----------
restaurant_id | String | The unique OpenTable Restaurant ID. (e.g. 55123)
location | String | A description of the location (e.g. Downtown)
country | String | Two-digit country location (e.g. US, DE, JA)

### Site_alternate_domain object 
Allows you to define alternate or secondary domains associated with this site. By default, these domains will be 301 redirected to the primary domain. If you change the is_redirect value to false, the alternate domains will resolve the website instead of performing the redirect. Each alternate domain will need to have its DNS settings configured the same way as the primary domain, read here for how to set these up. 

Property | Type | Required | Description
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
domains | Array | optional | An array of strings that contain fully qualified domain names. Each domain will be set to redirect to the primary domain of the site.
is_redirect | bool | optional | Defaults to true. If set as true, all alternate domains will be set to 301 redirect to the primary domain.

>Create a website:

```shell
curl -X POST -i https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/create \
	-u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{ "template_id": "1000772"}'
```

> Expected return:

```json
{
	"site_name":"28e1182c"
}
```

### Return
Upon successful creation of a website, Duda will return a site_name value along with a `200 OK` HTTP response. The site_name is a unique string (usually between 8 and 32 characters) across all Duda websites and will be needed to later access other resources, such as updating the site, getting analytics or granting access. We recommend storing this site_name in your database for later reference.

## Get site
Get information about an already existing website. You will need the site_name value that was provided during the create website call. 

<aside class="warning">Note that only properties that have values will be returned.</aside>

>Simple CURL to update business hours:

```shell
curl -X POST -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/57b6506a/content' \
    -u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \ 
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"location_data": {"business_hours": [{"days": ["SAT","SUN","MON"],"open": "00:00","close": "00:00"},{"days":["TUE","WED","THU","FRI"],"open":"09:00","close":"17:30"}]}}'
```

Update the content of the content that exists within the content library. This will update the data that exists within the content library and make it available during the site builds. For example, when adding a map, Duda will automatically populate the address from the content library. 

The data you can set is the exact same that you get from the content library API call.

### Method and path
`POST /api/sites/multiscreen/{site_name}/content`

### Parameters

- site_name

<aside class="notice">We do not currently support updating of content for `additional_locations`.</aside>

## Inject content

> Basic structure of inject content data

```json
[
  {
    "type": "INNERHTML",
    "key": "dataInjectValueToSearchFor",
    "value": "valueToReplaceContentWith"
  },
  {
    "type": "DOMATTR",
    "key": "dataInjectValueToSearchFor",
    "value": "attributeValueToAddToRefs",
    "refs": [
      "placeholderKeyToAddOrRepace1","placeholderKeyToAddOrRepace2"
    ]
  },
  {
    "type": "CSS",
    "key": "dataInjectValueToSearchFor",
    "value": "cssValueToAddToBlock:rgba(0,0,0,1)",
    "refs": [
      "cssPropertiesToAddOrReplace1","background-color","background"
    ]
  }
]
```

Content injection allows you to change a website via API (text, images, CSS, etc..) direclty on an existing website or template. You can update CSS values, InnerHTML of an elemnt or an attribute on an element. For the InnerHTML and Attr types, you must have the `data-inject=value` set on the element. For the CSS type, you must have a `data-inject:value` CSS property set within a declaration block. 

This feature primarily works by sending the `type` value to alter the markup or styling in multiple ways. Should pass Duda an array of JSON objects. For a full example of content injection.


### Method and path

`POST /api/sites/multiscreen/inject-content/{siteName}`

### Types of injection

Below you will see the three types of injection available: `CSS`, `DOMATTR`, and `INNERHTML` along with how Duda expects each one to be sent.

> Example

```shell
# If you have this HTML & CSS block within the website:
#
# <a class="u_1454453128 dmNewParagraph email-css" data-inject="email" id="1454453128" href="mailto:oldEmail@domain.com">oldEmail@domain.com</a>
#
# .email-css {
#	data-inject: email-css;
#	color: #474747;
# }
#
# And run this: 
curl -X POST -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/inject-content/b4ra2g' \
	-u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \ 
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '[
			{
				"type": "INNERHTML",
				"key": "email",
				"value": "newEmail@domain.com"
			},
			{
				"type": "DOMATTR",
				"key": "email",
				"value": "mailto:newEmail@domain.com",
				"refs": [
					"href"
				]
			},
			{
				"type": "CSS",
				"key": "email-css",
				"value": "#000000",
				"refs": [
					"color"
				]
			}
		]'
# The code will be updated to:
# <a class="u_1454453128 dmNewParagraph email-css" data-inject="email" id="1454453128" href="mailto:newEmail@domain.com">newEmail@domain.com</a>
#
# .email-css {
#	data-inject: email-css;
#	color: #000000;
# }
```

### INNERHTML 

Property | Type | Description
---------- | ---------- | ----------
type | String | **INNERHTML**: Replaces all content (HTML, text, etc..) within this element. 
key | String | The value of the `data-inject` attribute on the element. For example, if you have `data-inject=email` you should place `email` as the value. Duda will then search through every page of the site and replace the innerHTML of all elements that contain the `data-inject=email` attribute.
value | String | The content you want to be placed within the element. Can be static text, HTML, etc.

### DOMATTR
Property | Type | Description
---------- | ---------- | ----------
type | String | **DOMATTR**: Allows you to add or update the attributes of the element. 
key | String | The value of the `data-inject` attribute on the element. For example, if you have `data-inject=email` you should place `email` as the value. Duda will then search through every page of the site and add or replace the DOM attributes of all elements that contain the `data-inject=email` attribute.
value | String | The value of the attribute you are wanting to add. For example, if you want to change the `src` of an image, you would place the direct URL of the image as the value. 
refs | Array of Strings | The keys of the attributes you want to add or replace. For example, if you want to alter the `src` of an image, you would place `src` as a string here. 

### CSS
Property | Type | Description
---------- | ---------- | ----------
type | String | **CSS**: Allows you to add or update CSS values within the block that the CSS value `data-inject:name` is present.
key | String | The value of the `data-inject` attribute within the CSS block. For example, if you have `data-inject:email-css` you should place `email-css` as the value here. Duda will then search through every CSS file of the site and replace the values of the reference strings you pass.
value | String | The CSS value you want to update. This could be `none` for the display property, a URL for background-image or a color code (HEX or RGB) for color values, for example. 
refs | Array of Strings | The property of the CSS you want to update. This will find the property you pass here and update with the value above.


### Return 

Duda will return a `204 No Content` HTTP response code.

<aside class="notice">The inject content API only updates the development version of the website. If you'd like to see these changes on the live website, make sure that you publish the website after making these updates.</aside>

## Get Inject Content Values

Search the website for all references of the data-inject value, either in the HTML or CSS of the website. This returns to you the existing properties that can be used for data injection later.

This can also be used to get the actual content of a specific element within the website. 

> Example 1 of one button within the website that contains a data-inject="read-more-btn" attribute assigned to it:

```shell
curl -u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \  
-X GET -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/inject-content/b4ra2g' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

> Response 1

```json
[
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "DOMATTR",
    "ref": "class",
    "value": "u_1330691906 align-center dmButtonLink dmWidget dmWwr default dmOnlyButton dmDefaultGradient"
  },
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "DOMATTR",
    "ref": "href",
    "value": "/about"
  },
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "DOMATTR",
    "ref": "dmle_widget",
    "value": "dudaButtonLinkId"
  },
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "DOMATTR",
    "ref": "id",
    "value": "1330691906"
  },
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "DOMATTR",
    "ref": "data-inject",
    "value": "read-more-btn"
  },
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "INNERHTML",
    "value": "<span class=\"iconBg\" id=\"1206527425\" duda_id=\"1206527425\"> <span class=\"icon hasFontIcon icon-star\" id=\"1686467387\" duda_id=\"1686467387\"> </span></span><span class=\"text\" id=\"1307805474\" localization_key=\"templates.custom.197\" duda_id=\"1307805474\">      Read More     </span>"
  }
]
```

> Example 2, filtering for only the INNERHTML:

```shell
curl -u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \  
-X GET -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/inject-content/b4ra2g?type=INNERHTML' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

> Example 2 response:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "read-more-btn",
    "type": "INNERHTML",
    "value": "<span class=\"iconBg\" id=\"1206527425\" duda_id=\"1206527425\"> <span class=\"icon hasFontIcon icon-star\" id=\"1686467387\" duda_id=\"1686467387\"> </span></span><span class=\"text\" id=\"1307805474\" localization_key=\"templates.custom.197\" duda_id=\"1307805474\">Read More</span>"
  }
]
```

### Method and path

### Return

You can expect a `200 OK` HTTP response code along with an array of json objects describing the inject content possibilities.

## Upload resources
Upload resources to the website from an external source. Today, this only supports images, but might be extended in the future for other types of media. This will upload the resource to the CDN that Duda uses and make it available to anyone building the website. This API is commonly used in conjunction with the [inject content API]( #inject-content) to insert new images directly into the website.

<aside class="warning">Please make sure files you upload have the correct extension. For example, PNG images should have .png and JPEG should have .jpg or .jpeg.</aside>

### Method and path

`POST /api/sites/multiscreen/resources/{site_name}/upload`

> Input example:

```json
[
  {
    "src": "http://www.dudasupport.com/test/beach.jpg",
    "recource_type": "IMAGE"
  },
  {
    "src": "http://www.dudasupport.com/test/field.jpeg",
    "recource_type": "IMAGE"
  }
]
```

### Input parameters
Duda expects an array of JSON objects that contain a source (src) and resource_type attribute. 

Property | Type | Required |Description
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
src | URL String | Required | A public URL for the resource. This must be publically available so that Duda can copy it to our CDN / storage associated with the website.
resource_type | String | Required | The type of resource being uploaded. Today, the only allowed value is IMAGE.

> Example

```shell
curl -X GET -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/published?lastDays=30' \

	-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Generate SSL Certificate

Generate a SSL certificate for a specific website. This will enable a HTTPS connection between site visitors and the Duda platform. It usually takes 15-30 minutes to successfully generate a SSL certificate for a website. You can get the status of the SSL certificate by calling the [GET site API](#get-site) and checking the certificate_status parameter. Once the certificate is successfully generated, all website visitors will be redirected to the HTTPS connection. This can be disabled on by updating the site force_https value to false. You do not need to worry about renewing the certificate, as Duda will do this automatically.

### Method and path

`POST /sites/multiscreen/{site_name}/certificate`

URI Parameter:
- site_name

### Return

Upon success, Duda will return a `204 No Content` HTTP code.

```shell
curl -X POST -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/b4ra2g/certificate' \
	-u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \ 
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

<aside class="warning">Before sending this API call, it's important that the domain is successfully pointed to Duda's servers. We only currently offer Domain Verified (DV) certificates. As part of the API call, Duda will verify that the domain is correctly pointing at the platform. If it is not, Duda will return an error.</aside>


## Delete SSL Certificate

Delete a certificate that has been generated for a website. This will ensure that the website is served over only an HTTP (insecure) connection and will delete the generated certificate.

### Method and path

`DELETE /sites/multiscreen/{site_name}/certificate`

URI Parameter:
- site_name

### Return

Upon success, Duda will return a `204 No Content` HTTP code.

```shell
curl -X DELETE -k 'https://api.duda.co/api/sites/multiscreen/b4ra2g/certificate' \
	-u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \ 
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
