## Generate SSO link
Generate a Single Sign-On link that will send a user to a specific page in the platform. You can generate a link to: The dashboard, the editor, stats page or to reset a site. If you are sending the user to the stats, editor or reset pages, you will need to pass the site_name and target as a parameter on the request URL. After generating the link, you should direct the users browser to this URL.

The link you generate will have a valid SSO token appended to it which will be valid for two minutes. 

If you are generating a link to a specific site for a customer, please make sure the customer has been granted access to the site and also has appropriate permissions. For example, if the customer does not have access to statistics, then you will be unable to generate an SSO link to the stats page.  

> cURL Example:

```shell
curl -S -u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \ 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X GET \
-k https://api.duda.co/api/accounts/sso/johnsmith@gmail.com/link​?target=STATS&site_name=146856ab
```

### Method and path
`GET /accounts/sso/{account_name}/link?target=EDITOR&site_name=h5de912a`

### Paramters

You must send a valid account_name as part of the URI parameter. There are several optional URL query paramters you can add on the request. If you pass the stats, Site Editor or Reset Site targets, you must also add a site_name parameter for the website that you are wanting to give the user access to. 

> JSON Response:

```json
{  
  "url": "http://example.mobilewebsiteserver.com/home/site/146856ab?dm_sso=2!eyJyZXFVdWlkIjoiYzU0Y2E0MzYwNDA2NDgwZDlmZmM2MTIxY2FiOTM2MzAifQ"
}
```

Target Location | Query Key | Query Value | Description
---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------
Dashboard | (none) | (none) | Send the user directly to their website dashboard. You do not need to send a target or site_name parameter.
Stats | "TARGET" | "STATS" | Send the user directly to the website statistics page. 
Site Editor | "TARGET" | "EDITOR" | Send the user directly to the white labeled website builder.
Stats | "TARGET" | "RESET_SITE" | Send the user directly to the select new template / reset site page. Note that if the user does reset the site, all existing website edits will be lost and the site will be reset to a new template that is selected. 

<aside class="warning">SSO Links & Tokens should be generated on demand and should not be generated upon page load or be statically linked to. SSO Tokens are only valid for two minutes, so you need to verify in real time that the user is authenticated to your system, then generate the SSO link once they intend to enter the editor, dashboard, stats, etc..</aside>

## Generate single sign-on token

> cURL Example

```shell
curl -S -u 'APIusername:APIpassword' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X GET \
-k https://api.duda.co/api/accounts/sso/johnsmith@gmail.com/token​
```

<aside class="notice">We recommend using the generate SSO Link API instead of the Generate SSO Token. It is easier to use.</aside>

Generate a token that will grant sub-accounts access to your white label portal. By calling this API, Duda will return a token that you can be append to the end of your SSO Endpoint in order to authenticate a sub-account directly into your white label account. To generate a Single Sign-On Token for a specific site, you must first give access to a specific site for the Sub-account you want to access that site. Duda will return a URL Parameter with a key and a value. Use this key value pair to append the Token on to the SSO Endpoint URL.

### Method and path
`GET /accounts/sso/{account_name}/token`

### Parameters:

- account_name - URL Parameter - Account name

### Return:

HTTP Code: 200 OK 

> JSON Response example:

	"url_parameter" : {  
		"name" : "dm_sso",
		"value" : "2|eyJyZXFVdWlkIjoiYTZjMGRjNGU0MTZiNDdiM2FmZGIyNTkzOGYxMjk4ODYifQ"
	}
}
```

## Grant customer access to a site

Give a Customer account access to a a specific site. This will allow them to access the site inside their account. Both site and account resources must exist already. You may pass an optional JSON permissions array that gives the customer access only to certain features. If no permissions object is passed, the customer will be given access to all features by default.

When giving customers access to a site, it is important to note that some permissions are dependent on other permissions being present. For example, you cannot give a customer access to a site's SEO if they do not have permission to edit the site first. See below for which permissions are dependent on others for each site type. 

If you would like to update the permissions that a specific customer has to a site, you can call the same API to overwrite any existing permissions. 

### Method and path
`POST /accounts/{account_name}/sites/{site_name}/permissions`

```json

"permissions":
